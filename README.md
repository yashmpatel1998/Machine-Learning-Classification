# Machine-Learning-Classification
In this notebook I have practiced various classification algorithams such as KNN, Decision tree, Support Vector machine and logistic regression to predict the status of loan.

I used pandas library to load the data and applied the algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
